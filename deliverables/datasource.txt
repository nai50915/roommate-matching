Data Generation Approach
-------------------------------------------

Unable to find Kaggle datasets, we opted to generate our synthetic data programatically with 2 files 
for 2 purposes: UserDataGenerator.java to generate 1000 new users to our web application and 
ReviewDataGenerator.java to generate 300 reviews made by one user to another. 

--------- UserDataGenerator.java ---------
The user table has these attributes:
- ** userId: autoincremented in ddl.sql
- firstName: wrote a String[] of >50 first names and generated different first and last name combos amongst each
- lastName: wrote a String[] of >50 last names and generated different first and last name combos amongst each
- password: all have the same bCrypt password, "1234"
- description: all descriptions follow this format, gave the users extra attributes like age and residence
"Hi! My name is %s. I am %d and I am looking for a roommate in %s %d this Fall. Hit me up!"
%s = firstName
%d = random age between 18 and 24
%s = residence
%d = residence number 
- imageUrl: all imageUrl follow this format, gave the users extra attributes like gender
" "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/" + (isMale ? "men/" : "women/") + faceId"
https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/ = generates different images if given a gender and a number between 1 and 99, so 
for example https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/45.jpg generates an image of a man with a hightop and glasses 
- faceId = random number from 1 to 99 

The review table has these attributes:
- reviewerId: since users are autoincremented from 1 to 1000, this is a random number from 1 to 1000
- revieweeId: random number from 1 to 1000, excluding the id in reviewerId since it doesn't make sense for a person
to write their own review 
- content: small set of String[][] templated comments chosen at random, correpsonding with a rating 
- ratingValue: random integer 1 to 5, each rating has a small set of templated comments
- ** timestamp: default sql time based on insertion
