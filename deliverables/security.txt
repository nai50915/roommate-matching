Password Storage and Authentication Approach
-------------------------------------------

The BCryptPasswordEncoder class from Spring Security uses the bcrypt 
hashing algorithm to safely store all user passwords. Bcrypt is designed to 
be slow and computationally intensive, which helps protect against
brute-force attacks.

Key Security Details:
- Algorithm: bcrypt
- Library: org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder
- Storage: Passwords are stored as BCrypt hashes in the database, rather than storing plaintext passwords.
- Salted Hashes:  Each password is uniquely and automatically salted before hashing. 

Authentication Process:
- User submits their username and password
- System retrieves the stored password hash for the username
- BCrypt compares the submitted password against the stored hash
     - Raw passwords are validated during login using BCryptPasswordEncoder's `matches()` method.
- Access is granted only on successful match
